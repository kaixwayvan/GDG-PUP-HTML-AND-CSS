    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Haii! I'm <em>Daniel</em>, a curious and passionate learner, always striving to 
      grow and achieve my goals.<br> I'm currently in my sophomore year, 
      pursuing an Information Technology program at the Institute of Technology.<br>

      <br>One interesting thing about me is that, while I’m an introvert, I still 
      enjoy attending social gatherings.<br> Though I may be quiet at times, I’m 
      always observant and love connecting with others in meaningful ways.<br> I also
      love solving puzzles, asking why, and finding creative ways to approach challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      <b><em>When I'm not at my desk</em></b>,</em>
      I enjoy taking my cutie doggo for walks to stay active and spend quality time with her.<br>
      I also enjoy playing badminton, which keeps me energized and physically fit, and practicing dance, as it allows me to express myself creatively.<br>
      To unwind, I indulge in light gaming for fun and relaxation—games like Roblox, <em>so if u wanna play, hmu!!</em><br>
      Occasionally, I do galas with family and friends, where we indulge with the busy atmosphere of the city.<br>
      Lastly, I love exploring new technology concepts, which fuels my curiosity and keeps me intellectually engaged.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      ⦾ <b>Develop</b> a solid understanding of web technologies through hands-on experience<br>
      ⦾ <b>Enhance</b> my skills in coding and logical thinking<br>
      ⦾ Working on projects that <b>challenge</b> me and push my limits<br>
      ⦾ Eventually sharing my learning journey with others to <b>inspire and collaborate</b><br>
